            <b>All the participants have to fill the form before attempting the hunt</b><br>
            The answer should be typed in <b>lower case without any space</b>.<br>
            <br>
            No special characters allowed.<br>
            <br>
            If you think the answer contains any number, write it as a word. For E.g. - Answer is 3-Idiots, you have to enter it as threeidiots.<br>
            <br>
            
            Once you have solved a question CORRECTLY, Take a SCREENSHOT and send it to any "Crypt-To-Cliq Game Manager" on discord. He will provide you The Photography Type in which the photo of that object has to be clicked and uploaded.<br>
            <br>
            ​
            
            riddles/questions will be displayed on the website, which will point towards some object. Once you enter the correct answer you'll have to upload an originally clicked photograph of the product on the website itself. <br>
            <br>
            For e.g.- "WHAT CAN BE USED ONLY AFTER it's CRACKED?" the answer would be an egg. So you have to click a picture of an egg and upload it.<br>

            <br>
            ​
            
            Teams will be judged on the basis of the <b>number of questions</b> solved as well as their <b>PHOTOGRAPHY SKILLS</b>.<br>
            <br>
            ​
            
            <b>Remember clicking a good photograph is equally important as solving the question because the photographs also contain points.<br>
                <br>
            ​
            
            If any team is caught uploading photos from the web they'll be disqualified. </b><br>
